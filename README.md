#quantstart-event-driven-backtester

This repository is the **hand-written (no copying and pasting here, noob!)** completion of an ~~eight~~seven-part* article series written by [Michael Halls-Moore](http://www.quantstart.com/about-mike/), "the guy behind QuantStart.com":

1. [Event-Driven Backtesting with Python - Part I](http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-I)
2. [Event-Driven Backtesting with Python - Part II](http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-II)
3. [Event-Driven Backtesting with Python - Part III](http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-III)
4. [Event-Driven Backtesting with Python - Part IV](http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-IV)
5. [Event-Driven Backtesting with Python - Part V](http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-V)
6. [Event-Driven Backtesting with Python - Part VI](http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-VI)
7. [Event-Driven Backtesting with Python - Part VII](http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-VII)
8. [Event-Driven Backtesting with Python - Part VIII](http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-VIII)

*Note: I say ~~eight~~seven-part article series because Part VIII is specifically for corresponding with Interactive Broker's API, which is beyond the scope of the academic exercise this repository represents.
